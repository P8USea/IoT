This is for the IoT App Developing class in my college HUS. It should be written in Vietnamese however I have some troubles with iBus Bamboo on my Linux Laptop, sorry for the inconvenience.

I use the Mathertel/OneButton @ ^2.6.1 library for LED controlling in this project. 
The main things to get into the context: 
- Set the button pin and active level
- Set the LED pin and active level
- btnDoubleClick-function's attached to DoubleClick event that fires the input led to blink
- btnPush-function's attached to Click event that fires the input led flip the state ON-OFF

2 last above points bring a change to my homework project.
